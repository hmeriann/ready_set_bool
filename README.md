# ready_set_bool
42 project - An introduction to Boolean Algebra


## General rules
- Use the language you want. There are a few constraints for your language of choice, though:
1 - It must support generic types
2 - It must support functions as first class citizens (example: supports lambda expressions)
3 - It must natively implement bitwise operations over integer types, or at least bitwise operations over a bitmap/boolmap type; though the former is strongly recommended
- Optional: support for operator overloading
- You are not allowed to use any mathematical library, even the one included in your language’s standard library, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- For every exercise you may have to respect a given time and/or space complexity. These will be checked during peer review.
- The time complexity is calculated relative to the number of executed instructions
- The space complexity is calculated relative to the maximum amount of memory allocated simultaneously
- Both have to be calculated against the size of the function’s input (a number, the length of a string, etc...)
